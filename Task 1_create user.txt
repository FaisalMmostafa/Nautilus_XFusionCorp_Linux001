For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team 
has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, 

rather than its default user. This will be the Apache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:


a. Create a user named kareem on the App server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.


b. Set its UID to 1786 and home directory to /var/www/kareem.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
First we will provide id for user and then need to change user default directory( home drectory) to /var/www/kareem.


 1) first check any existing user with name karrem?
        #id kareem
    you will see no username with kareem

      then
        #  useradd -u 1786 Kareem
        now check id
           # id kareem
     uid=1786(kareem) gid=1786(kareem) groups=1786(kareem) 
    2) Now need to change the default directory to /var/www/kareem

           you can test the curent directory like this
                # cat /etc/passwd |grep Kareem
               kareem:x:1786:1786::/home/kareem:/bin/bash

        # usermod -d /var/www/kareem -m kareem
      # cat /etc/passwd |grep Kareem
            kareem:x:1786:1786::/var/www/kareem:/bin/bash   
                                       // changed home/kareem to /var/www/karrem
