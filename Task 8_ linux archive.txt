On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC, there is a storage location named /data, which is used by different developers to keep their data (non confidential data). One of the developers named kirsty has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of their data present in /data/kirsty directory on storage server. /home is a FTP location on storage server itself where developers can download their data. Below are the instructions shared by the system admin team to accomplish this task.


a. Make a kirsty.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/kirsty directory and move the archive to /home directory on Storage Server.
$  ssh kirsty @ststor01
$ sudo su â€“
ls-la /data/ kirsty    [ list of files of Kirsty]
tar -czvf  kirsty.tar.gz  /data/kirsty/  [archive the file inside the file of kirsty]
check the file  # ls -la
                          kirsty.tar.gz 

# mv kirsty.tar.gz  /home/
# ll  /home/
