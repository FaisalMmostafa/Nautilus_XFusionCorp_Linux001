On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:
a. soft limit = 80
b. hard_limit = 92
Please Note:-  Perform the below commands based on your question server,  user name & other details that might differ as per the task.

Soln:
1.
thor@jump_host /$ ssh natasha@ststor01
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -

 2.  Edit limit.conf file as below vi /etc/security/limits.conf
[root@ststor01 ~]# vi /etc/security/limits.conf
nfsuser         soft    nproc   80
nfsuser         hard    nproc   92

3.  by cat command check the edit file
root@ststor01 ~]# cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
nfsuser         soft    nproc   80
nfsuser         hard    nproc   92
