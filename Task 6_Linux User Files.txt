There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 3 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. Find the details below:


On App Server 3 find all files (not directories) owned by user siva inside /home/usersdata directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /beta directory.

1
ll /home/usersdata/

2 ls -la /media

Total 0

3. find the files by user and copy with folder structure
find /home/usersdata/ -type f -user siva -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;
by above command the user ownership change to root

or to keep same ownership of siva
find /home/usersdata/ -type f -user -p siva -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;
