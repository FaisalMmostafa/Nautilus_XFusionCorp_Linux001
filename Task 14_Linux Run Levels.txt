New tools have been installed on the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are some requirements for these app servers as below.


On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter, change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. Please do not try to reboot these servers after completing this task.

Soln:

sudo su –

systemctl get-default
multi-user.target
# systemctl set-default graphical.target   [Run Below command to change the run level to graphical.target ]

Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/default.target to /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target.

# systemctl status graphical.target
