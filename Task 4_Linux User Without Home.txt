A developer named kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for kareem. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.


Therefore, create a user named kareem on the App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2024-03-28. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.




sudo adduser Kareem
    2  sudo chage -E 2024-03-28  Kareem--TO ADD EXPIRY DATE TO LINUX USER 
    3  sudo chage -l Kareem   --TO SEE ALL INFORMATION FOR LINUX USER
