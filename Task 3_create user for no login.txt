The System admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers. As per the tool's requirements they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell.


Therefore, create a user named jim with a non-interactive shell on the App Server 2.



[root@stapp02 steve]# useradd -s /bin/false jim

Or 
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin jim


what is  non-interactive shell
A non-interactive shell in Linux is a shell session that does not provide an interactive command-line interface for user interaction. Unlike interactive shells, which allow users to execute commands and receive immediate feedback, non-interactive shells typically have limited functionality and are often used for specific purposes such as running scripts or performing automated tasks.
