There are specific access levels for users defined by the xFusionCorp Industries system admin team. Rather than providing access levels to every individual user, the team has decided to create groups with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed. See the following requirements:



a. Create a group named nautilus_noc in all App servers in Stratos Datacenter.


b. Add the user jarod to nautilus_noc group in all App servers. (create the user if doesn't exist).

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
