After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.


Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

: Disabling root login means preventing the ability for users to directly log in as the root user account on a system. The root user, also known as the superuser, has unrestricted access to all commands and files on a Unix-like operating system, including Linux. Allowing direct root logins can pose security risks because any mistakes or malicious actions performed by a user with root privileges can have serious consequences, potentially compromising the entire system.


--------------------------------------------------
1.	 sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.	 #PermitRootLogin yes

Change it
                 #PermitRootLogin no
3.	sudo systemctl restart sshd
before :
banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su



After :
 [banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su
[root@stapp03 banner]#
